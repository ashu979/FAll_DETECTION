# FAll_DETECTION
A machine learning model , which detects falls in elderly people .Elder people with neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson disease often  fall. This leads to the damage of physical condition and mental condition.

Our project presents a machine learning framework consisting of data collection, pre-processing  of data, feature extraction and machine learning algorithms. They consist of Decision Tree, Random Forest, Grid Search Ensemble, Extra Tree Ensemble, ADA Boost and XG Boost. The dataset which has been used in our project is from SisFall which is publicly available.

/** IMPLEMENTATION **/

1. Cleaning the data.
2. Removing outliers .
3. Splitting the data.
4. Decision Tree Classifier.
5. Random forest Classifier.
6. Grid search ensemble.
7. Extra Tree Ensemble.
8. ADA Boost Classifier .
9. XG Boost Classifier .


/** Results obtained **/
